# Ayybot
This is a silly Discord bot. 

## To use:
1. Clone the repository.

2. Create a file named auth.json in the directory. The contents of the file should be { "token": "YOUR TOKEN HERE" }.

3. npm install (make sure node is fairly up-to-date)

4. node bot

You can change the bot's icon from Discord's Developer Portal.
