# Ayybot
This is a silly Discord bot. Its most complicated function is validating people. 

## To use:
1. Clone the repository.

2. Create a file named auth.json in the directory. The contents of the file should be { "token": "YOUR TOKEN HERE" }.

3. npm install (make sure node is fairly up-to-date).

4. node bot
